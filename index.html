                <p class="accordion-p"> It provides intense and even brow tinting, has a gel texture for easy application and additionally cares for the skin and hairs thanks to the vegan protein in the composition. </p>
                <h4 class="accordion-h4">What should I mix ÉLAN Gel Tint with?</h4>
                <p class="accordion-p">The paint must be mixed with Oxidant 1% or Oxidizing Emulsion 3.5% from ÉLAN.</p>
                <h4 class="accordion-h4">What is the difference between oxidants?</h4>
                <div class="accordion-block">
                    <ul class="accordion-list">
                        <li>Oxidant 1% — gives a more natural shade, does not darken the hairs.</li>
                        <li>Oxidizing Emulsion 3.5% — creates a richer shade on both skin and hairs.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h4 class="accordion-h4">How to use Gel Tint correctly?</h4>

                    <ol class="accordion-list">
                        <li>Cleanse the eyebrows before tinting (ÉLAN DETOX-MOUSSE is recommended).</li>
                        <li>Build the desired eyebrow shape.</li>
                        <li>Mix the tint with an oxidant in a 1:1 ratio.</li>
                        <li>Apply the mixture, leave for 5-15 minutes depending on the desired result.</li>
                        <li>Rinse off with a damp cotton pad or ÉLAN DETOX-MOUSSE.</li>
                        <li>Fix the result with the ÉLAN COLOUR FIX fluid.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            
                <h4 class="accordion-h4">Does the colour of the tint change after opening?</h4>
                <p class="accordion-p">Yes, the colour may vary from light brown to black due to contact with air. This is normal and does not affect the tinting result.</p>
            
                <h4 class="accordion-h4">Can I use Gel Tint for lashes?</h4>
                <p class="accordion-p">No, the product is intended for eyebrows only.</p>
            
                <h4 class="accordion-h4">What should I do if the tint gets outside the eyebrow shape?</h4>
                <p class="accordion-p">Immediately remove with a cotton swab moistened with water, not allowing the paint to dry on the skin.</p>
                <h4 class="accordion-h4">How long does the tinting result last?</h4>
                <p class="accordion-p">The duration of the effect depends on the skin type, care and individual characteristics, usually up to several weeks</p>

        <h3 class="accordion-h3">SMART BROW TINTING SYSTEM 2.0</h3>
        <div class="accordion-block">
            <h4 class="accordion-h4">Can I scrub my skin before applying the tint?</h4>
            <p class="accordion-p">No. Scrubbing the eyebrows partially injures the upper layer of the skin (epidermis), which may cause burning and redness during tinting.</p>

            <h4 class="accordion-h4">What is the durability of the skin and hairs tinting?</h4>
            <p class="accordion-p">The SBTS 2.0 tinting system guarantees long-lasting skin tinting for up to 14 days, while the hairs will be tinted for up to 30 days. Remember that it all depends on your skin type and hairs structure.</p>

            <h4 class="accordion-h4">Is it possible to cover tattoos with the new SBTS 2.0 tinting system?</h4>
            <p class="accordion-p">Yes, you can cover tattoos with the new SBTS 2.0 tinting system. The eyebrows will have a dense and rich shade.</p>
           
            <h4 class="accordion-h4">Can ÉLAN Gel Tint and the new SBTS 2.0 tinting system be mixed together?</h4>
            <p class="accordion-p"> No, because these are two independent tinting systems that have different compositions and different principles of action.</p>
           
            <h4 class="accordion-h4">How many tints are in the new SBTS 2.0 paint system?</h4>
            <div class="accordion-block">   
            <span class="accordion-span">The SBTS tinting system comes in three shades:</span>

                <li>04 ICY cold brown;</li>
                <li>05 SPICY warm brown;</li>

                </div>
            <h4 class="accordion-h4">What is the percentage of Oxidizing Emulsion in the new SBTS 2.0 tinting system?</h4>
            <p class="accordion-p">The percentage of Oxidizing Emulsion in the new SBTS tinting system is 2%. The volume of one bottle of Oxidizing Emulsion is enough for one tube «Deep Brow Tint 2.0».</p>
           
            <h4 class="accordion-h4">What alkali is used in the new SMART BROW TINTING SYSTEM?</h4>
            <p class="accordion-p">The new SMART BROW TINTING SYSTEM 2.0 tinting system uses the innovative DMAMP ULTRA PC alkali. This is a revolutionary agent, the use of which allowed to reduce the percentage of oxidation pigments in the tint, thereby reducing the possible risk of an allergic reaction. It was this alkali that made it possible to achieve a neutral pH.</p>
            <h4 class="accordion-h4">What is the difference between SMART BROWN TINTING SYSTEM 2.0 and the ÉLAN professional line Gel Tint?</h4>
            <div class="accordion-block">
                <ol class="accordion-list">
                    <li>The tint does not contain ammonia and ethanolamine: the classic alkalis in the tint have been replaced by a functional analogue — a new generation development — a revolutionary agent, the use of which has reduced the percentage of oxidation
                        pigments in the tint, thereby reducing the possible risk of an allergic reaction.</li>
                    <li>The composition of the tint has no analogues: the hydrogen pH of the finished tinting mixture is 7. «Deep Brow Tint» eyebrow tint by TM ÉLAN professional line is the first eyebrow dye with a neutral pH, which does not injure hairs and does not dry out the skin.
